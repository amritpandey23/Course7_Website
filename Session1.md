## About
This course is about teaching you complete full-stack software development and making you independent to choose the framework of your choice to continue your development journey.
In this course, we will be starting by understanding the stacks used and then using them to create an app.
This course is delivered in the form of a workshop so 50% of the coding will be done by me and the **rest 50% will be done by you** in the form of classwork or assignments.
The objective of this course is to make you comfortable in using all the tools at your disposal to create any web app of your choice hence I expect a lot of coding to be done by you.
Finally, I do not encourage you to take this course for the sake of a certificate only as the things you will learn will outweigh the significance of any piece of paper.
So I wish you all luck and Happy Coding!

## What are we going to build?
In this course, we are going to build two apps. 

## Downloads

[here](./downloads/Session3_CSS.zip)

### Single Page Landing Site in pure HTML & CSS
The first app will be a simple single-page website landing page which will be hosted on the GitHub Pages. We are going to create everything from scratch (no libraries). We are going to learn HTML5 and CSS3. We then will be using some JavaScript for interactivity. Finally, we will deploy our site on Github Pages and Netlify. After finishing this app you have an in-depth understanding of how front-end websites are built and hosted. Here is the [example site](https://www.okape.co.in/).

### Book Review Website
The second app will be a simple book review website where we will be creating our book review website. Here we will use various backend technology such as python's web framework called Flask, SQL database, ORMs, etc. And will be learning about various backend technologies like REST, CMS, etc. Finally, we will host this app on a Cloud service like AWS and buy a custom domain to publish our app to the internet. After building this app you will have full knowledge of full-stack software development in Python and you have enough knowledge to start learning and developing websites and apps in any language of your choice.

## Discussion
We will use WhatsApp group to discuss anything related to assignments outside of class and the general discussion will take place within the class itself. Important notifications will be sent by me over email as well.

## Certification Criteria
Those who attend 80% of the class will be awarded *a Certificate of Participation*. In addition, if someone completes the entire course with all the assignments then they will be awarded *a Certificate of Appreciation*. These certificates will be issued by CCPD, NIT Warangal.

## Installation of Software/Tools
In this course I have kept Windows OS as the default OS for development however the development can take place in any OS of your choice with some minor changes.
The list of tools you need to keep installed in your systems is as follows:
